Title:

  Responsive Covid-19 Tracker

Description:
  
  A health tracker that allows users to see the worst ten states prepopulated or search for their state to see covid-19 statistics.

User Story:

  AS A concerned citizen
  I WANT to track covid cases near myself and my family
  SO THAT I know how at risk we are
  
Acceptance Criteria:

  WHEN the page loads
  THEN the landing page displays the worst ten states statistics
  WHEN I click one of the states I see more statistics on that state
  OR IF I search a new state I see statistics on that state
  STATISTICS shown are total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, and *maybe testing centers* etc
  WHEN I navigate to the HELP page 
  THEN I see a form to check my symptoms 
  IF I check enough then it recommends I seek medical advice
